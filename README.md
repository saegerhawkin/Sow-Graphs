# Exploring Sow Data With Python
During my 2019 summer internship at Johnsonville I explored some functionality of Python. I took some open sourced USDA data from their website: https://www.usda.gov/topics/data I was mostly concerned with looking at sow data because this is what Johnsonville purchases for their sausages. These are my initial tests of different Python packages.

There are three notebook files in this repository.
